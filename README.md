## **About The Project**

I wanted to create a portfolio that was a bit different from the standard template. As a developer, I spend most of my time in the terminal, so I thought, "Why not make my portfolio a terminal too?"

This project is a fully functional, responsive web application built with Flutter. It mimics a terminal interface where visitors can use simple commands to navigate through my skills, projects, education, and contact information.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Terminal:** A familiar interface for developers.  
* **Command-Based Navigation:** Use commands like /help, /about, /skills, and more.  
* **Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
* **Cool Animations:** Smooth text animations to mimic a real terminal experience.  
* **Easy to Customize:** Built with clean code, making it easy for you to fork and create your own version.

## **Available Commands**

Here are the commands you can use to explore the portfolio:

| Command | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| /help | Shows a list of all available commands. |
| /about | Displays a short bio about me. |
| /skills | Lists my technical skills and proficiencies. |
| /projects | Showcases some of the projects I've worked on. |
| /education | Outlines my educational background. |
| /contact | Provides my contact information and social links. |
| /clear | Clears the terminal screen. |
